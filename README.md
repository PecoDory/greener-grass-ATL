## Purpose
<br>

This is a fullstack application that will allow users to post their day-to-day exploits as urban gardeners/farmers in Atlanta, as well as allow other users to comment on these posts, fostering a dialogue (tips, tricks, glass content in the soil) between local growers.  
<br>

## MVP

- Sign Up/Login
- A place to post about yr daily routine and the nature of growing and foraging in the city wilds
- Comments from other users relating their experiences of the day
- A fitting aesthetic for the content

<br>

### Post-MVP

- A way to visually map the locations of gardens and food forests in Atlanta (if a user is so inclined to disclose this info, or if it is public)
- A quick-guide to what grows best in our zone that can be edited by users
- A field-guide for foraging connected to an identification app

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. Include a link to your component tree

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like.
