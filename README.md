## Purpose
<br>

This is a fullstack application that will allow users to post their day-to-day exploits as urban gardeners/farmers in Atlanta, as well as allow other users to comment on these posts, fostering a dialogue (tips, tricks, glass content in the soil) between local growers. 
<br>

## MVP

- Sign Up/Login
- A place to post about yr daily routine and the nature of growing in the city wilds
- Comments from other users relating their experiences of the day
- A fitting aesthetic for the content

<br>

### Post-MVP

- A way to visually map the locations of gardens and food forests in Atlanta (if a user is so inclined to disclose this info, or if it is public)
- A quick-guide to what grows best in our zone that can be edited by users
- A field-guide for foraging connected to an identification app

### Front-End Client 

#### Wireframes

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. Include a link to your component tree

[Component Tree Sample](https://gist.git.generalassemb.ly/davidtwhitlatch/414107e2560ae0bb65e233570f2fe056#file-component-tree-png)

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` 

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

### Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

> Use this section to display an image of a computer generated ERD model. You can use draw.io, Lucidchart or another ERD tool.

## Post-MVP

> Use this section to document ideas you've had that would be fun (or necessary) for your Post-MVP. This will be helpful when you return to your project after graduation!
